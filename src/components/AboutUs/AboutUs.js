                        <p className="text-start lh-1">You are not alone. Over the past eleven years, I’ve helped millions of people answer those questions and travel more for less with time tested and proven tips and advice. By using this website, you can spend less time searching the Internet and being overwhelmed with information and more time doing the one thing you want to do: travel more. Growing up in Boston, I was never a big traveler. It just wasn’t something my friends or family did. I didn’t take my first trip overseas until I was 23. After college, I got a job and the standard American two-weeks-a-year vacation. For that first trip in 2004, I went to Costa Rica. The experience changed my life. It opened me up to all the possibilities the world had to offer. There, I experienced another culture, wildlife I had only read about in books, new foods, got lost in a jungle, saw conservation projects in action, and met people from around the world. There, in the wonderful city of Chiang Mai, I met five backpackers who showed me that I didn’t have to be tied down to my job or be rich to travel. They were five people who were living my dream of traveling full-time. I wanted in. I wanted to do what they were doing. After that trip, I flew home, finished my MBA, quit my cubicle job, and, in July 2006, set out on an adventure around the world that continues to this day.</p>
